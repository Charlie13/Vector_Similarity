# Vector_Similarity
* Python, Java implementation of TS-SS called from "A Hybrid Geometric Approach for Measuring Similarity Level Among Documents and Document Clustering"
* I recommend TS-SS instead of Cosine distance or Euclidean distance.

# The reasons are... :

## Cosine drawbacks

## Euclidean drawbacks

## Triangle's Area Similarity (TS)
